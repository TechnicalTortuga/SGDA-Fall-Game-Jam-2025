# Texture System Updates

## Changes Made

### 1. AssetSystem Updates
- Modified `GetTexture` methods to return `Texture2D` by value instead of pointer
- Updated `HasTexture` to check both the ref count and texture manager
- Fixed texture loading and caching logic
- Added proper error handling for texture loading failures
- Fixed `Texture2D` initialization with proper default values
- Removed code that took addresses of temporary `Texture2D` objects
- Fixed syntax errors in error handling and control flow

### 2. Renderer Updates
- Updated `SetupMaterial` to work with the new texture handling
- Modified `RenderBSPGeometry` to properly use `MaterialComponent` and texture system
- Cleaned up `RenderFace` method and fixed syntax errors
- Ensured proper texture binding and unbinding
- Improved UV coordinate calculation for different face orientations

### 3. Texture Management
- All textures are now managed through the `TextureManager` with reference counting
- Textures are properly unloaded when no longer in use
- Texture handles are used consistently throughout the codebase
- Added proper error logging for texture loading failures

### 4. Bug Fixes
- Fixed syntax errors in `RenderFace` that were causing rendering issues
- Fixed texture coordinate calculation for different face orientations
- Added proper error handling for texture loading failures
- Ensured proper cleanup of resources

### 5. Code Quality Improvements
- Removed unused variables and parameters
- Added proper error messages for debugging
- Improved code organization and documentation
- Fixed compiler warnings

## Next Steps
1. Test the changes by running the game
2. Verify that textures are properly displayed on BSP surfaces and skybox
3. Monitor memory usage to ensure proper cleanup of textures
4. Add more detailed error handling if needed

## Known Issues
- Some compiler warnings about unused parameters may still exist
- Additional testing is needed to ensure all edge cases are handled
