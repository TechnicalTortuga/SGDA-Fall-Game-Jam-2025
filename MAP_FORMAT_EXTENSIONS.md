# PaintSplash Map Format Extensions (v2.1)

## Overview

The PaintSplash map format is a binary format designed for fast loading and efficient storage, built around our entity-component system. It's optimized for paint-based gameplay with support for dynamic surface painting and team-based mechanics.

### Key Features

- **Entity-Component Based**: Direct mapping to our ECS architecture
- **Efficient Binary Format**: Optimized for fast loading and minimal memory footprint
- **Paint System**: Support for dynamic paint application and blending
- **Multiplayer Ready**: Built with networked gameplay in mind
- **Level Streaming**: Support for large, streamable levels

## Design Philosophy

1. **Entities First**: Everything in the level is an entity with properties
2. **Performance-Oriented**: Structure optimized for fast loading and rendering
3. **Extensible**: Easy to add new entity types and properties
4. **Human-Readable**: YAML-based for easier debugging and hand-editing
5. **Binary-Compatible**: Designed to be easily convertible to a binary format

## Entity Reference

### Light Types

#### 1. Point Light
Omnidirectional light source that emits light in all directions from a single point.

```yaml
- id: 1000
  class: "light_point"
  name: "point_light_01"
  transform:
      position: [x, y, z]
  properties:
      color: [255, 255, 255]  # RGB (0-255)
      intensity: 1000.0       # Light intensity
      radius: 1000.0          # Maximum distance light affects
      cast_shadows: true      # Whether to cast shadows
      shadow_bias: 0.005      # Shadow mapping bias
      shadow_resolution: 1024 # Shadow map resolution
```

#### 2. Spot Light
Directional light that emits light in a cone shape.

```yaml
- id: 1001
  class: "light_spot"
  name: "spot_light_01"
  transform:
      position: [x, y, z]
      rotation: [x, y, z, w]  # Direction is forward vector of rotation
  properties:
      color: [255, 255, 255]
      intensity: 2000.0
      range: 2000.0
      inner_angle: 30.0  # Inner cone angle (degrees)
      outer_angle: 45.0  # Outer cone angle (degrees)
      cast_shadows: true
      shadow_bias: 0.005
```

#### 3. Directional Light
Infinite directional light source (like the sun).

```yaml
- id: 1002
  class: "light_directional"
  name: "sun"
  transform:
      rotation: [x, y, z, w]  # Direction is forward vector
  properties:
      color: [255, 245, 235]  # Slightly warm white
      intensity: 1.0          # 0.0-1.0 scale
      cast_shadows: true
      shadow_map_size: 2048    # Shadow map resolution
      shadow_cascade_count: 3  # Number of cascades for CSM
      shadow_distance: 10000.0 # Maximum shadow distance
```

### Common Properties

All entities share these common properties:

- **transform**: Position, rotation, and scale
- **name**: Unique identifier for the entity
- **tags**: Array of string tags for grouping/querying
- **visible**: Whether the entity is visible
- **locked**: Whether the entity can be modified in the editor

## Binary Format Specification

### File Structure
```
[Header]
- Magic: 'PSMP' (4 bytes) - PaintSplash Map Format
- Version: (uint16) - Format version
- Entity Count: (uint32) - Number of entities
- String Table Offset: (uint32) - Offset to string table
- Component Type Count: (uint16) - Number of component types

[Entity Section]
- For each entity:
  - ID: (uint32) - Entity ID
  - Component Count: (uint16) - Number of components
  - Components: (variable) - Component data

[Component Data]
- Component Type: (uint16) - Index into component type table
- Data Size: (uint32) - Size of component data
- Data: (bytes) - Serialized component data

[String Table]
- Count: (uint32) - Number of strings
- For each string:
  - Length: (uint16)
  - String: (bytes) - UTF-8 encoded string

[Component Type Table]
- Count: (uint16) - Number of component types
- For each type:
  - Name: (string) - Hashed component name
  - Version: (uint16) - Component data version
  - Size: (uint32) - Size of component data
```

### Component Serialization
Each component must implement:
- `size_t GetSerializedSize()` - Returns size needed for serialization
- `void Serialize(uint8_t* buffer)` - Writes component to buffer
- `void Deserialize(const uint8_t* buffer)` - Reads component from buffer

### Example Component (PaintableSurface):
```cpp
struct PaintableSurface {
    uint32_t texture_size[2];
    uint8_t max_layers;
    float paint_absorption;
    float paint_spread;
    bool cleanable;
    // ... other fields ...

    size_t GetSerializedSize() const {
        return sizeof(texture_size) + sizeof(max_layers) + 
               sizeof(paint_absorption) + sizeof(paint_spread) + 
               sizeof(cleanable);
    }

    void Serialize(uint8_t* buffer) const {
        memcpy(buffer, texture_size, sizeof(texture_size));
        buffer += sizeof(texture_size);
        *buffer++ = max_layers;
        memcpy(buffer, &paint_absorption, sizeof(paint_absorption));
        buffer += sizeof(paint_absorption);
        // ... serialize remaining fields ...
    }
};
```

## Multiplayer and AI Considerations

### Networked Entities
- All entities that can affect gameplay must be network-replicated
- Client-side prediction for player movement and actions
- Server authoritative for game state
- Entity interpolation for smooth movement

### AI System
- Navigation meshes for pathfinding
- Behavior trees for AI decision making
- Sensory system (sight, sound, etc.)
- Team awareness and coordination
- Dynamic difficulty adjustment

### Game Mode: Territory Control

**Objective**:
- Teams compete to cover the map in their team's color
- Score points based on the percentage of map controlled
- Control key areas to earn bonus points

**Core Mechanics**:
- Paint surfaces by shooting them with your team's color
- Paint over enemy paint to claim territory
- Water and certain surfaces can clean paint
- Collect paint ammo pickups to refill

**Scoring**:
- 1 point per second per 1% of map controlled
- 2x points for controlling key areas
- Match ends when time runs out or score limit reached

### Implementation Notes

materials:
    material:
        id: 0
        name: "textures/walls/brick"
        properties:
            diffuse: "brick_diffuse.png"
            normal: "brick_normal.png"
            specular: "brick_specular.png"
            shininess: 0.5
            double_sided: false
```

### 6. Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: UV Coordinates
1. Extend face format to include UVs

3. Modify Face struct to store parsed UVs
4. Remove automatic UV calculation

#### Phase 2: Entity System
1. Add entity parsing to MapLoader
2. Create EntityFactory for spawning map entities
3. Implement basic entity types (lights, props)

#### Phase 3: Event System
1. Add event parsing and storage
2. Create EventManager system
3. Implement trigger volumes and event dispatching

#### Phase 4: Mesh Instances
1. Add mesh instance parsing
2. Integrate with existing MeshComponent system
3. Support material overrides

#### Phase 5: Advanced Features
1. Brush-based entities
2. Visibility groups
3. Lighting baked data
4. Metadata and versioning

## Source Engine Comparison

Source Engine's VMF format includes:

- **Geometry**: Brushes with faces (vertices + UVs + materials)
- **Entities**: Point entities + brush entities
- **Materials**: VMT files with shader parameters
- **Lighting**: Lightmap UVs + baked lighting data
- **Visgroups**: Grouping for organization
- **Cameras**: Editor camera positions
- **Cordon bounds**: Compile boundaries

Our extended format should cover similar functionality while being optimized for our ECS architecture.

## Migration Strategy

1. **Keep backward compatibility** with existing maps
2. **Version field** to distinguish format versions
3. **Gradual rollout** - implement features incrementally
4. **Conversion tools** for upgrading old maps

## Parser Architecture Changes

### New Parser Structure

### Face Parsing Extension
```
ParseFace(const std::string& line) -> Face
âââ ParseVerticesWithUVs()  // x,y,z,u,v for each vertex
âââ ValidateWinding()       // ensure correct normal direction
âââ CalculateTangents()     // for normal mapping
âââ AssignMaterial()        // material ID lookup
```
