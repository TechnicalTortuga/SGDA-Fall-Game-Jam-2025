## 🚨 **CRITICAL: ECS Architecture Violations Identified**

### **Immediate Violations Requiring ECR (ECS Compliance Refactoring)**

#### **1. Component Coupling Violations** 🔴
- **Owner Entity Reference**: `Component.h` stores direct Entity* owner - violates data-only principle
- **Heavy Resource Storage**: `MeshComponent` stores `Texture2D` directly - components should be lightweight
- **Logic in Components**: `MeshComponent` has transform/rotation methods - logic belongs in systems
- **Non-ECS Coupling**: Components reference `materialId_` from non-ECS `WorldGeometry`

#### **2. System Responsibility Violations** 🔴
- **WorldSystem Overload**: Handles map loading + material creation + texture loading + entity creation
- **Mixed Rendering**: Static geometry in `WorldRenderer`, dynamic in `RenderSystem`
- **Resource Management**: `WorldGeometry` manages materials (non-ECS managing ECS concerns)

#### **3. Resource Management Violations** 🟡
- **Direct Texture Storage**: Components hold heavy `Texture2D` objects instead of lightweight IDs
- **No Reference Counting**: No automatic cleanup when textures are no longer referenced
- **Mixed Ownership**: ECS and non-ECS systems both manage the same resources

#### **4. Architecture Violations** 🟡
- **Tight Coupling**: Systems depend on specific component implementations
- **Cross-Contamination**: ECS and non-ECS concerns are mixed throughout
- **No Clear Boundaries**: Hard to test systems independently

## 🛠️ **ECR (ECS Compliance Refactoring) Plan**

### **Phase 1: Foundation & Safety Nets** (Week 1-2)
- ✅ Create backup branch: `git checkout -b ecs-refactor-backup`
- ✅ Implement ECSValidator for runtime validation
- ✅ Add comprehensive logging and error recovery
- ✅ Create ISystem interface with standardized lifecycle

### **Phase 2: AssetSystem Implementation** (Week 3-4)

- ✅ Remove direct texture storage from MeshComponent

### **Phase 3: Component Migration** (Week 5-6)
- ✅ **TransformComponent** - Enhanced Position with scale/rotation/parenting

### **Phase 4: System Refactoring** (Week 7-8)
- ✅ **WorldSystem Decoupling** - Focus only on map loading and static geometry
- ✅ **MaterialSystem** - Handle material creation and assignment
- ✅ **MeshSystem** - Handle procedural mesh generation and updates

## 🌐 **PHASE 4: MULTIPLAYER & NETWORKING** (Q2 2026 - POST-ECR)

### **Network Architecture** (ECR-Ready Design)

#### **Transport Layer Decisions**
- **UDP-Based**: Low-latency for FPS movement and paint projectiles
- **P2P Mesh**: Direct player connections with relay server for NAT traversal
- **Delta Compression**: Position/velocity updates with prediction/correction
- **Authority Model**: Server-authoritative for paint/scoring, client-side prediction for movement

#### **Network-Aware ECS Components**
```cpp
// Network-ready components (post-ECR)
struct NetworkComponent : public Component {
    uint32_t networkId = 0;        // Unique across network
    uint32_t ownerId = 0;          // Owning client ID
    NetworkAuthority authority;     // Server/Local/Proxy
    float lastUpdateTime = 0.0f;   // For interpolation
};

struct InterpolatedTransformComponent : public Component {
    Vector3 position;
    Vector3 velocity;
    Quaternion rotation;
    // Network interpolation data
    Vector3 targetPosition;
    Quaternion targetRotation;
    float interpolationTime = 0.0f;
};
```

#### **Network Systems Architecture**
```cpp
src/networking/               # New directory post-ECR
├── NetworkSystem.cpp        # Core network management
├── ReplicationSystem.cpp    # Entity state synchronization
├── InterpolationSystem.cpp  # Client-side prediction/interpolation
├── TransportLayer.cpp       # UDP connection management
└── NATTraversal.cpp         # P2P connection establishment
```

### **Team System (PaintWars Mechanics)**
- **Color-Based Teams**: 4 teams with distinct paint colors (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow)
- **Territory Control**: Paint coverage percentage determines score
- **Dynamic Spawn Points**: Team-controlled spawn areas
- **Win Conditions**: Time-based or percentage-based victory

### **Paint Networking**
- **Projectile Synchronization**: Authoritative server validation
- **Surface State**: Distributed paint decal management
- **Ownership Resolution**: Server arbitration for overlapping paint
- **Bandwidth Optimization**: Region-based paint updates
